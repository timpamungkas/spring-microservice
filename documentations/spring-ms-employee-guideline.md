# Employee
Sample microservice created using [JHipster Generator](https://jhipster.github.io/creating-an-app/). Basically this is a Spring Boot applications that runs as [Eureka Client](https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-netflix/blob/master/docs/src/main/asciidoc/spring-cloud-netflix.adoc#service-discovery-eureka-clients). 
This will use entity generated by jhipster using [this guidance](https://jhipster.github.io/creating-an-entity/)

## !!! Source Code in This Repository
This source code repository is meant only for example purpose. When creating a new project, it is recommended that you use create new JHipster application using latest JHispter release.

## Installation
To start with microservice, [create a jhipster application](https://jhipster.github.io/creating-an-app/).
In this example, I use JHipster 3.10 with following combination (my answer in **bold**) during JHipster generation:

1. (1/13) Which *type* of application would you like to create? **Microservice application**
2. (2/13) What is the base name of your application? **employee**
3. (3/13) As you are running in a microservice architecture, on which port would like your server to run? It should be u
nique to avoid port conflicts. **8082**
4. (4/13) What is your default Java package name? **com.springms.employee**
5. (5/13) Which *type* of authentication would you like to use? **JWT authentication (stateless, with a token)**
6. (6/13) Which Service Discovery and Configuration solution would you like to use? **JHipster Registry (using Eureka and Spring Cloud Config)**
7. (7/13) Which *type* of database would you like to use? **SQL (H2, MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Oracle)**
8. (8/13) Which *production* database would you like to use? **MySQL**
9. (9/13) Which *development* database would you like to use? **H2 with disk-based persistence**
10. (10/13) Do you want to use Hibernate 2nd level cache? **No**
11. (11/13) Would you like to use Maven or Gradle for building the backend? **Maven**
12. (12/13) Which other technologies would you like to use? **None**
13. (13/13) Would you like to enable internationalization support? **No**
14. (14/13) Which testing frameworks would you like to use? **None**

*Server app generated successfully.*

Jhipster also available to create a client skeleton. I thought by default it will create server & client app, but in my case it's just generating server app. Thus I generate client app using this command : `yo jhipster:client` with this combination:

1. (1/3) Would you like to use the LibSass stylesheet preprocessor for your CSS? **No**
2. (2/3) Would you like to enable internationalization support? (Y/n) **No**

## Creating the Entity
* Entity **Employee** generated by jhipster using this command `yo jhipster:entity Employee --table-name employees`. The **Employee** will have following fields generated:
 * full_name (String max 50 char, required)
 * birth_date (LocalDate, required)
 * gender (String max 10 char, required)
 * id_number(String max 20 char, not required)

This is parameter I used when generate the **Employee**:

1. Add fields as described above
2. Do you want to add a relationship to another entity? **No**
3. Do you want to use a Data Transfer Object (DTO)? **No, use the entity directly**
4. Do you want to use separate service class for your business logic? **Yes, generate a separate service interface and implementation**
5. Do you want pagination on your entity? **Yes, with pagination links**

## Run The Example
1. Make sure that service registry up and running on port 8761
2. (Optional) Make sure that API gateway up and running on port 8080
3. Run this project using `mvn spring-boot:run`
